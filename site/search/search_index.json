It was introduced by Fred Reichheld in his 2003 Harvard Business Review article, The One Number You Need to Grow2.</p> <p>Nowadays it is a widely used customer experience metric that helps organizations understand if their products and services are meeting the users' expectations by asking one survey question:</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely is it that you would recommend Company/Product/Service to a friend or colleague?</p> <p> </p> Example of an NPS survey <p>Respondents are divided into 3 categories based on their rating:</p> Rating Category Description 0-6 Detractors Respondents who are unsatisfied and may express negative opinions. 7-8 Passives Respondents who are satisfied, but not enthusiastic. 9-10 Promoters Respondents who are passionate and inclined to bring in new customers. <p>Many NPS surveys often complement this quantitative measure with an additional question that allows respondents to justify their rating by writing a short text. This is another relevant source of information that companies can use to understand their performance in a more detailed way.</p>"},{"location":"#how-to-measure-nps","title":"How to measure NPS","text":"<p>Once the results from the survey question are ready, calculating the Net Promoter Score is rather straightforward\u2014you just need to subtract the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters:</p> <p>Note</p> <p>NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors</p> <p>The resulting NPS value ranges from -100 to +100.

This way, NPS contributes to the long-term survival of a business.</p> </li> <li> <p>Branding enhancement: Since Net Promoter Score is widely adopted by many companies, achieving a high score increases recognition and reinforces the brand. It can also be used to obtain a greater promotional performance and stand out from the competition.</p> </li> <li> <p>Workplace wellfare: Companies can also use NPS to increase the satisfaction and advocacy of employees. This is known as eNPS (employee Net Promoter Score)4. It can become an essential metric to evaluate the overall level of internal engagement and increase talent retention and efficiency.</p> </li> </ul> <p>It is important to keep in in mind that, while NPS holds a significant value as a resource for businesses, its full potential is reached when combined with other customer feedback metrics.</p> <p>Besides, NPS should be used periodically in order to gather accurate data over time.
