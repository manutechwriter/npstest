# Updates (NEW)

These are the features that I added since the last meeting:

1. **Simplified Navigation**: Subheadings have been removed from the Table of Contents.
2. **Enhanced Search Functionality**: Now it suggests word completion while typing, with real-time previews. Accept suggestions using the right arrow key.
3. **Light and Dark Mode**: Switch between color palettes with a toggle next to the search bar.
4. **Effortless Editing**: Find the new Edit icon next to the main title of a document allowing direct edits on GitHub. Commits automatically trigger deployment with GitHub Actions.
5. **Back to Top**: Added a button to return to the beginning of the document. It appears below the top navigation bar at the center as soon as you scroll up.
6. **Live Pie Chart**: Implemented a mermaid [NPS live chart](https://manutechwriter.github.io/npstest/live-chart/) that updates automatically with JavaScript. It gets the data from a PostgreSQL database with a NodeJS backend that I developed separately.
7. **Added Giscus comments**: Implemented the Giscus comment system.
