It was introduced by Fred Reichheld in his 2003 Harvard Business Review article, The One Number You Need to Grow<sup>2</sup>.</p> <p>Nowadays it is a widely used customer experience metric that helps organizations understand if their products and services are meeting the users' expectations by asking one survey question:</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely is it that you would recommend Company/Product/Service to a friend or colleague?</p> <p> </p> Example of an NPS survey <p>Respondents are divided into 3 categories based on their rating:</p> Rating Category Description 0-6 Detractors Respondents who are unsatisfied and may express negative opinions. 7-8 Passives Respondents who are satisfied, but not enthusiastic. 9-10 Promoters Respondents who are passionate and inclined to bring in new customers. <p>Many NPS surveys often complement this quantitative measure with an additional question that allows respondents to justify their rating by writing a short text. This is another relevant source of information that companies can use to understand their performance in a more detailed way.</p> How to measure NPS <p>Once the results from the survey question are ready, calculating the Net Promoter Score is rather straightforward\u2014you just need to subtract the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters:</p> <p>Note</p> <p>NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors</p> <p>The resulting NPS value ranges from -100 to +100. The higher the score, the stronger the level of customer advocacy.</p> <p>However, if the NPS value falls into negative territory, which means that Detractors outnumber Promoters, that clearly indicates that there are opportunities for improvement.</p> <p>There are online tools that can help you with this process. For example, Qualtrics has an NPS Calculator on their website<sup>3</sup>.</p> <p>Info</p> <p>If the survey feedback is stored in a database, NPS can also be calculated using SQL (Structured Query Language).

This way, NPS contributes to the long-term survival of a business.</p> </li> <li> <p>Branding enhancement: Since Net Promoter Score is widely adopted by many companies, achieving a high score increases recognition and reinforces the brand. It can also be used to obtain a greater promotional performance and stand out from the competition.</p> </li> <li> <p>Workplace wellfare: Companies can also use NPS to increase the satisfaction and advocacy of employees. This is known as eNPS (employee Net Promoter Score)<sup>4</sup>. It can become an essential metric to evaluate the overall level of internal engagement and increase talent retention and efficiency.</p> </li> </ul> <p>It is important to keep in in mind that, while NPS holds a significant value as a resource for businesses, its full potential is reached when combined with other customer feedback metrics.</p> <p>Besides, NPS should be used periodically in order to gather accurate data over time. You could also include it as a part of a transactional process by sending a survey every time a specific product is sold.</p>"},{"location":"#nps-implementation","title":"NPS Implementation","text":"<p>There are different ways to implement Net Promoter Score.

Depending on your needs, you might just need to send a simple survey. However, you will probably use a more advanced configuration with different NPS surveys that are delivered periodically.</p> <p>To calculate the NPS data using SQL, you must obtain the respondents' information, such as their rating and comments, from data sources. But you can also use further details about each participant to classify their answers in a more targeted and practical way.</p> <p>Info</p> <p>Data sources in SQL in this case refers to the information that is stored in a relational database, which can be retrieved by executing SQL queries.</p> <p>These are the required data sources to which you must have access if you want to calculate the NPS value properly:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Respondent identification: The ID of each person that answers the NPS survey is the primary key that is needed. This should preferrabllly be a number instead of a name, an email or any other text, because the textual identification could change over time, whereas an ID number can remain inmutable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Respondent rating: Another source of information that is required to integrate the Net Promoter Score metric is the score provided by each respondent. This is the crucial numerical data that you need to extract the final NPS value.</p> </li> </ol> <p>You may also want to obtain additional optional information to complement your reporting and make the most of the NPS experience by using more accurate and practical data, such as:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Textual feedback: Although the NPS value is a number, it is also possible to gather information from a form field where respondents can write text to justify their answer. It is also possible to extract valuable insights with SQL from this data source.</p> </li> <li> <p>Date: The day or timestamp that the survey question was created, sent or submitted is another relevant piece of information that can give organizations a clearer idea of the evolution of the participants' feedback, especially if NPS surveys are sent periodically.</p> </li> <li> <p>Respondent background: Other aspects you may want to consider are the country, age, name and email, or any other relevant criteria of the participants' profile, to detect trends about the company's products and services in a more segmented way. The more detailed the data, the more refined solutions you could put in place.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Every business has its own needs, but many may share similar NPS data sources. For example, there could also be a table in the database that stores the information of each survey to keep track of different dates, software version, purposes and strategies.</p> Example of an NPS Data Source configuration <p>Example</p> <p>This section introduces a complementary sample scenario that can serve as a reference to understand a more comprehensive Net Promoter Score implementation using three tables as SQL Data Sources.</p> <p>Table 1: NPS Respondent</p> <p>This table would have all the information about every person who submits an NPS survey, such as the unique identifier, the name, the email, the country or any other related data.</p> <p>Thus, the name of this table could be <code>nps_respondent</code>, and it would look similar to this:</p> respondent_id respondent_name respondent_email respondent_country 1 Michael Doe mike@example.com England 2 Jonathan P\u00e9rez jona@example.com Spain 3 Sophie Larsson soph@example.com Australia <p>Tip</p> <p>Use column names that match your data. For example, if your NPS surveys are only targeting customers, you could use <code>customer_id</code> rather than <code>respondent_id</code>, <code>customer_name</code> instead of <code>respondent_name</code>, etcetera.</p> <p>Table 2: NPS Survey Responses</p> <p>This is where the feedback resides. Each answer to every field of an individual NPS questionnaire would be stored in this table. For example: the rating given by respondents, as well as the comment.</p> <p>This table should also include the identification number of each survey, and it would also be useful to have the date in which the responses were given.</p> <p>Therefore, this <code>nps_survey_responses</code> table would show like this:</p> response_id survey_id respondent_id rating comment response_date 201 101 1 9 Great product! 2023-06-17 202 101 2 7 Good but should be better 2023-06-18 203 102 3 8 Satisfactory service 2023-06-22 <p>Table 3: NPS Surveys List</p> <p>The <code>nps_surveys_list</code> table would be the source where you would get the details about the surveys themselves, each of them including its own identification number. To enable a clearer monitoring of the questionnaires, this table should also have the name of every survey, the date where it was either created or sent, and it would be a great idea to add a description too:</p> survey_id survey_name survey_description survey_creation_date 101 Product Feedback Feedback on our new product 2023-06-15 102 Service Quality Evaluation of our services 2023-06-20 <p>Last but not least, there could be additional data sources depending on the characteristics of each business.

Therefore, the <code>nps_respondent</code> table has a one-to-many relationship with the <code>nps_survey_reponses</code> table via the <code>respondent_id</code> column, which acts as a foreign key here. Another foreign key in this table is the <code>survey_id</code>, which is used to establish a many-to-one relationship with the <code>nps_surveys_list</code> table. Thus, many responses may be related to only one survey. The primary key in this table is <code>response_id</code>, which uniquely identifies every response. </p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>nps_surveys_list</code> table contains the data about each survey, such as its identification number, name, description and creation date.

It contains the responses from an NPS survey about a fictional software writing app. More specifically it is a table called <code>nps_survey_data</code> that has 4 columns: <code>respondent_id</code>, <code>rating</code>, <code>comment</code> and <code>survey_date</code>, and it is composed by 37 rows, each row representing the feedback of a respondent.</p> <p>The <code>nps_survey_data</code> table that will be used as an example for the following SQL queries looks like this:</p> respondent_id rating comment survey _date 1 9 Great software, very useful for my writing needs 2023-07-20 2 8 Easy to use and intuitive interface 2023-07-20 3 7 Good features, but could use more customization 2023-07-20 4 10 Excellent product, exceeded my expectations 2023-07-20 5 6 It's okay, but there are some bugs 2023-07-20 ... ... ... ... See the count of each rating separately <pre><code>SELECT rating, COUNT(*)\nFROM nps_survey_data\nGROUP BY 1\n</code></pre> <p>To begin with, you can use SQL to organize the data in a way that shows the count of each score. This way you will see how many respondents selected a specific number.</p> <p>To do that, we need to have two columns: one that shows each numerical rating in a different row and another that contains the count.</p> <ol> <li> <p>This code first retrieves the <code>rating</code> column from the <code>nps_survey_data</code> table and uses the <code>COUNT(*)</code> SQL function to add another column next to it, which contains the number of times every rating was chosen.</p> </li> <li> <p>Then, <code>GROUP BY 1</code> is used to aggregate the resulting table by the first column, which is <code>rating</code> in this case. The rating column will therefore be displayed on the left side, whereas <code>COUNT</code> will be placed right next to it.</p> </li> </ol> <p>When I run this code using my example database, this is the result:</p> rating count 5 3 8 8 6 4 10 7 7 7 9 8 <p>I can see that there are 7 respondents who gave a rating of 10, and 8 respondents who rated the app with a 9. This means that I have 15 Promoters!</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>You can visualize the resulting table in a graphic by exporting the query result data as a CSV or Excel file and uploading it to a software that can create graphics (e.g. Google Sheets, Canva).</p> Count Promoters, Passives and Detractors <pre><code>SELECT\n  CASE \n    WHEN rating IN (9, 10) THEN 'Promoter'\n    WHEN rating IN (7, 8) THEN 'Passive'\n    WHEN rating IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) THEN 'Detractor'\n    ELSE 'Error'\n  END AS nps_category\n  , COUNT(*)\nFROM\n  nps_survey_data\nGROUP BY 1\n</code></pre> <p>This SQL query provides a table that shows the number of Promoters, Passives and Detractors from our NPS survey responses.</p> <ol> <li> <p>First, it retrieves the data from the <code>rating</code> column in the <code>nps_survey_data</code> table, and presents the information in another table that is composed by two columns.</p> </li> <li> <p>The first column of the resulting table is called <code>nps_category</code>, and it is used to categorize respondents by their NPS category. Each of these categories is presented in a separate row. More specifically, this code labels each respondent as a Promoter, Passive or Detractor depending on their rating, which ranges from 1 to 10. These numbers come from the <code>rating</code> column of the <code>nps_survey_data</code> table.</p> </li> <li> <p>The second column is placed on the right side and is referred to as the <code>count</code> column, since it simply shows the count of each of the three segments (Promoters, Passives and Detractors) from the results of the NPS survey.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Once I run this query, this is the resulting table that is displayed:</p> nps_category count Promoter 15 Detractor 7 Passive 15 <pre><code>%%{init: {'theme': 'base', 'themeVariables': { 'pie1': '#2bc275', 'pie2': '#5f60ff', 'pie3': '#d74e26', 'pieStrokeWidth': '0px', 'textPosition': '0.5', 'pieOpacity': '1'}}}%%\npie \n  \"Promoter\" : 15\n  \"Passive\" : 15\n  \"Detractor\" : 7</code></pre> Calculate the NPS value <pre><code>SELECT SUM(nps_category * c)  * 100.0 / SUM(c) FROM (\n    SELECT CASE\n        WHEN rating IN (9, 10) THEN 1\n        WHEN rating IN (7, 8) THEN 0\n        ELSE -1\n    END AS nps_category, COUNT(*) AS c\n    FROM nps_survey_data \n    GROUP BY nps_category\n    ORDER BY nps_category\n) x\n</code></pre> <p>This code calculates the Net Promoter Score, which is a number that ranges from -100 to 100. It is therefore one of the most important SQL queries from this list.</p> <p>This is how it works:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The purpose here is to subtract the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters to obtain the NPS value. Therefore, we must give Promoters, Detractors and Passives a numerical value. To do that, we obtain the rating given by each respondent from the <code>rating</code> column that is stored in the <code>nps_survey_data</code> table.</p> </li> <li> <p>Then, we divide the ratings into three segments, each of them placed in its corresponding row. However, we do not set a textual value to such categories to distinguish them as Promoters, Detractors or Passives. Instead, we set Promoters (respondents who give a rating of 9 or 10) to have the number <code>1</code> as the value.</p> </li> <li> <p>Likewise, we give Passives (respondents who give a rating of 7 or 8) a value of <code>0</code>, since Passives are not taken into account for this NPS operation. As for Detractors, we give a <code>-1</code> value to them. These conditions are established in the <code>SELECT</code> subquery by using the <code>CASE</code> statement, which builds a column called <code>nps_category</code> with this information.</p> </li> <li> <p>This subquery also uses the <code>COUNT(*)</code> SQL function, which is simply aliased as <code>c</code>, to take into account the total number of respondents in the NPS category where they belong. And it uses the <code>GROUP BY</code> and <code>ORDER BY</code> SQL clauses to configure this information properly. This way every respondent can be retrieved and added to the calculation in an organized way.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, the outer <code>SELECT</code> query calculates the NPS value by summing the counts of Promoters and Detractors with the positive and negative numerical values from the subquery using the <code>SUM</code> function. This is then multiplied by 100 to turn it into a percentage, and the result of that is divided by the total quantity of responses.</p> </li> </ol> <p>When this operation is executed, I can see that the Net Promoter Score of our fictional writing app is 21 (more accurately, 21.62162).</p> Calculate the NPS value over time <pre><code>WITH nps_date_operation AS (\n  SELECT\n    date_trunc('day', survey_date) AS PERIOD,\n    COUNT(1) FILTER (WHERE rating &gt;= 9)::FLOAT AS promoter_count,\n    COUNT(1) FILTER (WHERE rating &lt;= 6)::FLOAT AS detractor_count,\n    COUNT(1)::FLOAT AS answers_count\n  FROM nps_survey_data\n  GROUP BY 1\n  ORDER BY 1\n)\n\nSELECT\n  PERIOD,\n  ((promoter_count/answers_count) - (detractor_count/answers_count)) * 100.00 as nps_value\nFROM nps_date_operation\nORDER BY 1;\n</code></pre> <p>Would you like to see how the NPS score evolves as time goes by? Then, you can use this query.</p> <p>This is a summary of what it does:</p> <ol> <li> <p>This code obtains the dates of the NPS questionnaires that are stored in the <code>survey_date</code> column from the <code>nps_data_table</code>. It organizes them by <code>day</code> as <code>PERIOD</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Then, it takes into account the total number of Promoters and the total number of Detractors separately, filtering and aliasing them as <code>promoter_count</code> and <code>detractor_count</code>. It also counts all the responses, that is, all the rows in the <code>nps_data_table</code> column.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the end, it subtracts Detractors from Promoters after dividing each of both categories by the total number of answers, and calculates the percentage from the result to obtain the NPS value organized by day as the <code>PERIOD</code>.</p> </li> </ol> <p>However, given my simple fictional database, I can only obtain feedback from 3 days that are very close to each other, and the NPS value doesn't change much in this case.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Although I used <code>day</code> as <code>PERIOD</code> to ellaborate this example, you can use month, year or another period that serves your needs.</p> period nps_value 2023-07-20 20 2023-07-21 23.0769 2023-07-24 21.4285 <p> </p> Example of NPS calculated over time Analyze textual feedback <pre><code>SELECT rating, word, COUNT(word) AS word_count FROM\n( \n    WITH cleaned AS (\n    SELECT respondent_id, regexp_replace(regexp_replace(regexp_replace(LOWER(comment), '[^\\w][\\d]+', ' '), '[!\\.,]+', ' ') , '\\s*', ' ') AS comment, \n    rating FROM nps_survey_data)\n\nSELECT respondent_id, word, rating FROM (\nSELECT respondent_id, regexp_split_to_table(comment, '\\s+') AS word, rating \nFROM cleaned\n) AS x\nWHERE char_length(word) &gt; 2 \nAND word NOT IN \n              ('a',\n               'an',\n               'and',\n               'are',\n               'as',\n               'at',\n               'be',\n               'but',\n               'by',\n               'for',\n               'if',\n               'in',\n               'into',\n               'is',\n               'it',\n               'no',\n               'not',\n               'of',\n               'on',\n               'or',\n               'such',\n               'that',\n               'the',\n               'their',\n               'then',\n               'there',\n               'these',\n               'they',\n               'this',\n               'to',\n               'was',\n               'will',\n               'with')\n) AS x\nGROUP BY rating, word\nORDER BY word_count DESC\n</code></pre> <p>The purpose of this query is to retrieve the comments and see the words that respondents wrote more times.</p> <p>More specifically, this code will return a table with three columns: one with the <code>rating</code>, another with a <code>word</code>, and a final column with the <code>word_count</code> that contains the number of times each word was used to justify a rating.</p> <ol> <li> <p>To begin this query, this code retrieves the data from the <code>comment</code> column that belongs to the <code>nps_survey_data</code> table, which contains the texts of every respondent.
