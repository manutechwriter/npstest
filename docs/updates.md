# Updates (NEW)

Hear are the latest improvements to the website:

1. **Simplified Navigation**: Subheadings have been removed from the Table of Contents.
2. **Enhanced Search Functionality**: Now it suggests word completion while typing, with real-time previews. Accept suggestions using the right arrow key.
3. **Light and Dark Mode**: Switch between color palettes with a toggle next to the search bar.
4. **Effortless Editing**: Find the new Edit icon next to the main title of a document allowing direct edits on GitHub. Commits automatically trigger deployment with GitHub Actions.
